    "Using the latitude and longitude and specific parameters, use the Google Places Nearby Search request to retrieve a hotel and add it to the Hotel Name column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step for retrieving hotels from a Nearby Search is to set the parameters for the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set the Parameters for a Nearby Search\n",
    "To find the nearest establishment to geographic coordinates, use the Google Places Nearby Search request. First, navigate to the Nearby Search requests page (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/search#PlaceSearchRequests%0D%0A).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nearby Search request lets us perform these tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Search for places within a specified area.\n",
    "2. Refine the search using keywords and specifying the type of place we are searching for.\n",
    "3. Use an API URL, where the output can be either XML or JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although very similar to our OpenWeatherMap API search, with the Google Places Nearby Search, we'll add a specified area and keyword to search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation states we must provide specific parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific parameters include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our API key\n",
    "2. A location, which will be the latitude and longitude\n",
    "3. A radius for the search. The radius can be up to 50,000 meters or approximately 31 miles. This distance is much too great for finding hotels, so we'll keep our search to 5,000 meters.\n",
    "4. If we use the rankby=distance for a parameter, we need to add one or more of the three parameters above. We won't use the rankby=distance because we will be searching based on the radius from a given latitude and longitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add optional parameters such as a keyword, a type of business, or the name of a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our hotel search, we'll use these parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. API key\n",
    "2. Latitude and longitude\n",
    "3. 5,000-meter radius\n",
    "4. Type of place\n",

    "To discover the support types we can use, click on the link \"list of supported types\" in the optional parameters list or navigate to the Place Types guide (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the webpage, Table 1 shows all the different Place types values. \"Hotel\" does not appear, but \"lodging\" does, so we will use the string \"lodging\" for the type parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to know how to add the other parameters in the search.\n",
    "\n",
